            We want to turn the tech hiring process on its head, creating a system
            that helps employers find better candidates and helps candidates
            attract employers who need the skills they have.
        </p>-->

        <p>
            By focusing on skills, we hope to encourage employers and candidates
            to think beyond the job description, moving into a process that is
            simpler and produces better results.
