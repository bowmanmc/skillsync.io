        <p>
            We started SkillSync because we want to help companies build diverse
            teams of dedicated developers and, at the same time, help candidates find
            positions they'll love.

                <h3>Michael Bowman</h3>
                <p>
                    Michael has been building web applications for over
                    fifteen years. During that time, he's
                    experienced first hand many of the difficulties managers have in building
                    development teams, as well as the difficulties software developers experience
                    when trying to find a new job. With SkillSync, he is committed to
                    encouraging a hiring process that is smoother and less painful for
                    everyone involved.
