    <p>
        We started SkillSync late in 2015 after a discussion about
        what the tech industry could be doing to fix the hiring process.
        Instead of just complaining, we came up with a list of things that could
        be done to help companies build diverse teams of dedicated developers,
        while at the same time, helping employees find positions that they'll
        love.
