                Michael has been building web applications for close to
                fifteen years, focusing on front-end technologies (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS)
                and user experience design. Having worked on both sides of the fence, he's 
                experienced first hand many of the difficulties managers have in building
                development teams, as well as the difficulties software developers experience
                when trying to find a new job.
